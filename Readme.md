##### Problem
---
All the available resources I've found to help educate people of good gardening habits are presented in large amounts of text that take` hours to sift through before one grasps an understanding of the basics.

I think this is crazy. 

Gardening is fun, simple, and really not much work on a small single-family scale. It should be presented as such.

---

##### Purpose
---
Consolidate Information: 
  * plant specs, requirements
  * good practices
  * helpful hints/gardener secrets

Present Information in an easily digestible way:
    * Use visual representations
    * Interactive interface
    * Present only the information that is required at the moment but make access to deeper information readily accessible.

Promote Responsibly
    * Tailor application to have a bias towards organic, non-chemical, environmentally friendly habits and proceedures.

##### Philisophical Reasoning
---
###### Considering we, as humans, all consume food to survive, it only seems logical that we should know how to garden.  This app attempts to consolidate plant specs and requirements into an easily digestible, visually pleasing, and intuitive interface.  Upon reaching my landing page, the user should already feel as though they are creating something, mentally visualizing the garden they will soon be planting in their backyards.
